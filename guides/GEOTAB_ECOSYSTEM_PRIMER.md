## Partner Success Stories

### Lytx + Surfsight: Video Safety at Scale

**The integration:** Lytx video telematics and AI-powered dashcams integrated directly into the Geotab platform. The Surfsight AI-12 camera uses machine vision to detect risky driving in real-time.

**Customer result:** 3 Sisters Logistics deployed Geotab GO devices with Lytx Surfsight cameras. Result: **30% reduction in insurance premiums ($45,000/year saved)** by providing their insurer with video evidence and safety data.

**The business model:** Lytx sells cameras and subscriptions through the Geotab Marketplace. Geotab resellers bundle them with GO devices.

---

### Bridgestone: Tire Intelligence

**The integration:** Bridgestone's IntelliTire TPMS (tire pressure monitoring system) connects through Geotab's IOX port. Tire data flows directly into MyGeotab.

**Customer result:** Internal studies with large waste fleets showed **40% reduction in tire-related downtime**.

**The partnership:** Bridgestone gained access to anonymized data from 4.5 million connected vehicles to develop their fleet mobility ecosystem. They also partnered with Fleetio to enable Geotab device installation at Firestone, Tires Plus, and other Bridgestone retail locations.

---

### Fleetio: Maintenance Management

**The integration:** Fleetio's fleet maintenance software syncs with Geotab for automated odometer updates, real-time vehicle tracking, and fault code alerts. When Geotab detects a check engine light, Fleetio can automatically create a work order.

**The reach:** Fleetio connects to 85,000+ national and independent maintenance shops across the US, automating in-house and external maintenance workflows.

**Why it works:** Fleet managers already use Geotab for telematics. Fleetio adds the maintenance layer without requiring duplicate data entry.

---

### Uptake: Predictive Maintenance AI

**The integration:** Uptake's machine learning models analyze engine diagnostic data from Geotab to predict component failures before they happen.

**The value:** Fleets avoid unplanned roadside breakdowns. Maintenance teams know which vehicles need attention and why—before the driver calls in with a problem.

**The ecosystem effect:** Uptake insights can flow into Fleetio to automatically generate work orders. Multiple Marketplace partners working together.

---

### Decisiv: Service Relationship Management

**The integration:** Decisiv manages the commercial vehicle service ecosystem—connecting fleets, dealers, and service providers. Their platform integrates with Geotab to share vehicle health data with service networks.

**The scale:** Largest asset service management ecosystem for commercial vehicles in North America.

---

### Netradyne + White Cap: Safety Transformation

**The challenge:** White Cap, a construction materials distributor with 600+ vehicles, needed to transform driver safety culture.

**The solution:** Geotab telematics combined with Netradyne AI cameras and driver coaching programs.

**The results:**
- **97% reduction** in speeding violations
- **97% reduction** in seatbelt violations
- **62% reduction** in aggressive driving
- **35% reduction** in accident frequency

**The business impact:** Dramatically lower insurance costs, fewer accidents, improved driver retention.
