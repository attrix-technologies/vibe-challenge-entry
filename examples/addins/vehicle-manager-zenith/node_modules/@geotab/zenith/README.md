<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

Zenith is a library of UI components on React that's essential for making Geotab's user interfaces consistent and speeding up development. It provides a full set of building blocks for creating UIs easily, and it's built on React, the default frontend library in Geotab. 
Zenith is a “view” layer - it utilizes React components to render a user interface. Typically your application has a state, user filters, states of popups,  Zenith doesn’t request data, doesn’t handle errors, doesn’t check clearances. It only renders components on the page and presents data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Project installation and Setup

Zenith is distributed as an npm package on [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Go to the root of your project and run the following command:
```
npm install @geotab/zenith --save
```

#### Import styles
Styles in Zenith library are located in the css file `@geotab/zenith/dist/index.css` which should be included in your project. Here is an example how to include them if your builder handles css imports:

```
import "@geotab/zenith/dist/index.css";
```

It can be also imported in your less/sass file.

<!-- USAGE -->
### Usage
If installed correctly you will be able to import components from the package:

```
import { Menu, Button, IconSettings3 } from "@geotab/zenith";
```

Now components are ready for usage.

### Available components
Zenith library provides components defined in Zenith Design System. It includes very basic blocks like colors, icons, font presets, atom components like buttons, checkboxes etc and high order components - header, table, filters bar etc. List of existing components can be found in [Storybook](https://developers.geotab.com/zenith-storybook/index.html).
